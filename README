-This project identifies and analyzes antibiotic resistance genes across multiple Klebsiella pneumoniae strains using a combination of Linux shell scripting for data retrieval and assembly, and R for downstream analysis and visualization.

##🖥️ Workflow Overview
1. Raw Data Download and Genome Assembly (Linux Shell Script)

Download raw sequencing data (.sra files) from NCBI SRA using sra-tools.

Convert .sra files to FASTQ format.

Assemble genomes for each strain using SPAdes.

Detect known antibiotic resistance genes with Abricate, generating .txt result files for each strain.

2. Resistance Gene Analysis (R Script)

Import Abricate output files into R.

Combine data across strains with strain identifiers.

Identify genes shared by all strains, unique genes per strain, and genes shared by some strains.

Visualize the number of resistance genes per strain using bar plots.

##📁 Dataset

.sra files downloaded via shell script (e.g., SRR35773224.sra).

Genome assemblies generated by SPAdes.

Abricate output files: SRR35773224.txt, SRR35773225.txt, ..., SRR35773228.txt.

Located in the data/ folder.

##🔧 Tools & Packages
Linux Shell Environment:

sra-toolkit (prefetch, fasterq-dump)

spades (genome assembler)

abricate (antibiotic resistance gene detection)

R Environment:

Language: R

Packages: tidyverse (data manipulation and plotting)

##📊 Key Results

Lists of shared, unique, and partially shared antibiotic resistance genes across strains.

Bar plots comparing resistance gene counts per Klebsiella pneumoniae strain.

##📂 Files

abricate_analysis.R: R script performing data analysis and visualization.

assemble_and_annotate.sh: Shell script for downloading, assembling, and annotating genomes.

data/: Folder containing raw data, assemblies, and Abricate output files.

##🧠 Notes

This pipeline leverages both command-line tools for heavy data processing and R for flexible data analysis.

The results provide insights into the distribution of resistance genes across clinical strains.
